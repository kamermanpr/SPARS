This script is part 6 of our analysis of the stimulus-response characteristics of the SPARS. In these analyses we assessed intra-individual and inter-individual variability in scoring on the SPARS at each pain intensity. 

We used the _median absolute deviation_ (MAD), which is a robust measure of dispersion, to assess variance. To calculate intra-individual variance for each stimulus intensity, we calculated the MAD using the ratings from repeated stimuli at each stimulus intensity. We also used the MAD for calculating inter-individual variance for each scale and at each intensity, using the median ratings by individuals at each intensity as the input.

**Median absolute deviation**  

$$MAD = median(|X_i - median(X)|)$$

# Intra-individual variation (participant-level)

```{r varianceP, fig.height = 9, fig.width = 9}
# Calculate MAD
data_varianceP <- data %>%
    group_by(PID, intensity) %>%
    summarise(MAD = mad(x = rating,
                        constant = 1, 
                        na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
    ungroup()

# Plot
ggplot(data = data_varianceP) +
    aes(y = MAD,
        x = sprintf('%.02f', intensity)) +
    geom_point(shape = 21,
               size = 4,
               stroke = 1,
               fill = '#FFFFFF') +
    geom_hline(yintercept = 10,
               linetype = 2) +
    labs(title = 'Participant-level median absolute deviation (MAD) for the SPARS',
         subtitle = 'Dotted line: 10% of scale range (100 units)',
         y = 'Median absolute deviation',
         x = 'Stimulus intensity (J)') +
    scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 25)) +
    facet_wrap(~ PID, ncol = 3) +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = -90))
```

There is no clear pattern in intra-individual variance in intensity rating within the scale. Variance can be high on a case-by-case basis, but most MAD value are < 10% of the scale range (100 units, -50 to 50).

# Inter-individual variation (group-level)

```{r varianceG}
# Process data for plotting
data_varianceG <- data %>% 
    # Calculate median rating at each stimulus intensity for each scale per PID
    group_by(PID, intensity) %>%
    summarise(median = median(rating, 
                              na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
    # Calculate group MAD
    group_by(intensity) %>%
    summarise(MAD = mad(median,
                        constant = 1,
                        na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
    ungroup()
    

# Plot
ggplot(data = data_varianceG) +
    aes(y = MAD,
        x = sprintf('%.02f', intensity)) +
    geom_point(shape = 21,
               size = 4,
               stroke = 1,
               fill = '#FFFFFF') +
    geom_hline(yintercept = 10,
               linetype = 2) +
    labs(title = 'Group-level median absolute deviation (MAD) for the SPARS',
         subtitle = 'Dotted line: 10% of scale range (100 units)',
         y = 'Median absolute deviation',
         x = 'Stimulus intensity (J)') +
    scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 25)) +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = -90))
```

Other than an 'odd' value at 1J, there is a trend for high inter-individual MAD values at low stimulus intensities, and for this variance to decrease as stimulus intensity increases.
