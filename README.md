# The Sensation and Pain Rating Scale (SPARS)

### Generate PDF copies of supplementary files 

## Information

**Do not merge this branch with _master_**

This branch of the SPARS repo was used to generate PDF copies of the supplementary files referenced in the SPARS mansucript. Minor changes were made to the YAML and the body of _*.Rmd_ scripts to generate PDF outputs. The names of these files use the format: _supplement\_\*.pdf_, where _\*_ is an integer numbering the file.
